It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2014 USENIX Conference on USENIX Annual Technical Conference}, pages = {305â€“320}, numpages = {16}, location = {Philadelphia, PA}, series = {USENIX ATC'14} }
